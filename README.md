# Airbnb Project
This project allows new users to register and signed up users to log in.
Each user can book an airbnb and add new airbnb to the database.
There is a section to see your bookings.
There are three sections, bookings (your ordered airbnbs), accomodations (your airbnbs list + an options to add a new airbnb), and a profile page, showing basic user information.

FrontEnd made using React Vite, TailwindCSS, Axios, and Date-fns.
BackEnd made using Mongoose, Express.js, Bcryptjs, Cookie-Parser, JsonWebToken, Multer and Dotenv.
