# Airbnb Project
This project allows new users to register and signed up users to log in.
You can order an airbnb booking and add a new airbnb place for others to book.
There are three sections, bookings (your ordered airbnbs), accomodations (your airbnbs list + an options to add a new airbnb), and a Profile page, showing basic user information.

FrontEnd made using React Vite, TailwindCSS, Axios, and Date-fns.
BackEnd made using Mongoose, Express.js, Bcryptjs, Cookie-Parser, JsonWebToken, Multer and Dotenv.
